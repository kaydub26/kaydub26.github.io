    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
    <body>
    1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
        * Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        * Recently when the Black Lives Matter march took place in Level 2, I decided to join which was destined to be breaking the social distance laws in place. For me, being young and in a small bubble without anyone with compromised immunity and of any great age I concluded that it was important for me to support a movement that so desperately needs to be pushed for people to understand the social injustices and imbalances that are institutionalised in our society, still today.
    
        * Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        * Growing up in a rural traditional pakeha conservative stable family has definitely given me a privileged upbringing and instilled a lot of healthy core values but also making friends from different backgrounds and ethnicities has kept my mind open as to how life can be for the not so privileged.

    2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
        * Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        * Growing up in a rural traditional pakeha conservative stable family has definitely given me a privileged upbringing and instilled a lot of healthy core values but also making friends from different backgrounds and ethnicities has kept my mind open as to how life can be for the not so privileged.
    
        * Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        * Simplicity has always been my go to. I feel that could have been a limiting factor with my career development as I have always preferred to put in in less than more work to get by. In saying that, I feel I do have a strength in my work ethic when I am presented a challenge of work to be done.
    
        * Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
        * Having a good work ethic should allow me to be able to complete sprints, although my time management has also been a flaw of mine.
    
        * Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
        * My most recent job was with my dad, which obviously presented its tensions between us. Communication was the most effective way to work through those times. Another idea of a work-through I could use would be presenting options to reach the desired outcome.
