      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?    </h1>
      
      <p>
        Before I explain what Margins, Borders and Paddings mean in “code”, we need to ensure we have content on our website to surround. Imagine you are looking at a floor plan of your home section - around your house you might have a garden and or a lawn which reaches your fence that defines the border of your section. In this analogy, the house being the content, the garden/ lawn is the padding to the fence which we would call our border. The margin could be thought of as the distance from the road to the fence, or the distance between your neighbours properties/houses. Generally, each property is different, much like websites are. Some don’t have lawns. Some have fences. Some are literally a thin wall away from their neighbour.

       <br> <h3>Padding</h3> 
        The padding edge surrounds the box padding. If the padding has 0 width, the padding edge is the same as the content edge. The four padding edges define the box's padding box
        <br> <h3>Border</h3>
        The border edge surrounds the box's border. If the border has 0 width, the border edge is the same as the padding edge. The four border edges define the box's border box
        <br> <h3>Margin</h3>
        The margin edge surrounds the box margin. If the margin has 0 width, the margin edge is the same as the border edge. The four margin edges define the box's margin box.
