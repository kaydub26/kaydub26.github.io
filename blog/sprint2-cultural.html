    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <body>
        * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        * All of them, that was a big part of the reason I chose to study with Enspiral. I want to see my communication and teamwork skills developed mostly.
        * Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        * I will be sure to reach out in times where I need help to manage my workload. Having a clear understanding between fellow humans around the course of what they feel of how I fit into each learning group/situation.
        * What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
        * I’m not particularly sure exactly what industry I want to spend the majority of my life contributing my energy into, if even I only want to choose one. I’ve always struggled with knowing what I want to do career wise. I have recently realised that a life as a trade is not something I want to do long term and would prefer to put hard labour work into my own assets if I ever own any.
        * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        * I will be sure to reach out to a facilitator or whoever next best suited when in times of needing help
        * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        * Answers or direction to find answers of questions or blockages in my learning.
        * Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
        * I will and have been having these, not yet communicated.
        * A description of your own strengths and limitations
        * Simplicity has always been my go to. I feel that could have been a limiting factor with my career development as I have always preferred to put in in less than more work to get by. In saying that, I feel I do have a strength in my work ethic when I am presented a challenge of work to be done
